UI changes in both fragments, Simplified some code


Hello there! This is the first Android Project I have made in my life. I always have been insterested in Android Development but never actually made a project before. 
I find it very challenging and joyful at the sametime. In this one week, I've learned alot about Android Studio, Java, Kotlin and Android Programming logic etc.
It was really hard learning all this stuff in a week and implement in a working application, For me who does not have any prior knowledge of Android, it was challenging.
Unfortunately what I created is nothing compared to what is been asked. It does not cover most of the requirements in the PDF. But considering my lack of knowledge I am 
still satisfied with results. If you are looking for somebody who wants to learn passionately I would love to take the chance! Thank you!
